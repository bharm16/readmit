// Wails publishes every bound method at window.go.<package>.<struct>.<method>.
// This module is the only place the frontend touches that surface, and the
// shapes below mirror internal/desktop exactly. The frontend never parses CLI
// output, never reimplements HL7 or case bundle semantics, and never sends any
// of these values to an analytics or rendering service: nothing leaves the
// machine. TestFrontendBindingsCoverTheFacade fails when a facade method is
// added without a declaration here.
